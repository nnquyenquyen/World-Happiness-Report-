# World-Happiness-Report-Analysis
The World Happiness Report Analysis project is a comprehensive exploration of the annual World Happiness Report dataset using SQL. The World Happiness Report, published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (United Nations), assesses global happiness based on various factors, including economic, social, and environmental well-being. This project aims to provide insights into global happiness trends and answer critical questions about the factors influencing happiness.

## Key Objectives:
+ Data Exploration: Import and preprocess the World Happiness Report dataset, ensuring data consistency and integrity.
+ Data Analysis: Conduct in-depth SQL analyses to extract meaningful insights from the dataset. Explore trends and patterns in global happiness scores over the years.
+ Correlation Analysis: Investigate relationships between happiness scores and various factors such as GDP per capita, life expectancy, freedom, generosity, and corruption. Calculate correlation coefficients to quantify these relationships.
+ Regional Analysis: Group countries by regions and analyze regional happiness variations. Identify regions with consistently high or low happiness scores and explore potential reasons.
+ Time Series Analysis: Analyze how happiness scores change over time and identify countries experiencing significant changes in happiness levels.
